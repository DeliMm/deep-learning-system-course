# 1. Introduction and Logistics 

Controversial claim: the single largest driver of widerspread adoption of deep learning has been the creation of easy-to-use automatic differentiation libraries. 

#### Learning Objects of the course 

1. understand the basic functioning of modern deep learning libraries, including concepts like automatic differentiation, gradient-based optimization.

2. be able to implement several standard deep learning architectures(MLPs, ConvNets, RNNs, Transformers), truly from scratch

3. understand how hardware acceleration (e.g. on GPUs) works under the hood for modern deep learning architectures, and be able to develop your own highly efficient code
